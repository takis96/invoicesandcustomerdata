For the implementation of the atm simulation i used Laravel with PHP 8.2.0 and MySQL (MariaDB is also fine)
I decided on Laravel because it gave me the ability to create secure restful api calls for every action needed on the instructions and I could also easily check them with corresponding tests.
To run the project you will need to clone the project locally and install PHP 8.2.0,  Composer, MySQL and to create a database. After you make sure you have installed Composer(Laravel), PHP, MySQL(or MariaDB), name the database whatever you want and create a user granting all privileges. Update these fields in .env file with what you've created:
DB_DATABASE=
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
After that, you should open the app's route with command line and run the following: 
php artisan migrate (to migrate to the database the tables needed)
php artisan serve (to run the application)

To test the actions you requested you can use any suitable interface or POSTMAN
